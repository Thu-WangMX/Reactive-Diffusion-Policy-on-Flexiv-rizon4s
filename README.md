# 🤖 Reactive Diffusion Policy on Flexiv Rizon4s

This repository is based on **Reactive Diffusion Policy (RDP)** and extends it to a **Flexiv Rizon4s** robot with a Flexiv-GN01 gripper and dual Intel RealSense cameras. It supports VR-based teleoperation and data collection for downstream policy learning.

This README focuses on **how to collect teleoperation data (demonstrations)** using:

- 🤖 Flexiv Rizon4s robot  
- 💻 A Linux PC (Ubuntu)  
- 📷 Two Intel RealSense cameras  
- 🕶️ A VR headset running the TactAR app  

---

## 1. 🧩 Hardware & Network Setup

1. **Robot ↔ PC (wired)**  
   - Connect the PC to the Flexiv controller using an Ethernet cable.  
   - Typical IPs (example):  
     - 💻 PC (wired): `192.168.2.101`  
     - 🤖 Flexiv robot: `192.168.2.100`

2. **PC ↔ VR (Wi‑Fi)**  
   - Connect both the **PC** and the **VR headset** to the **same Wi‑Fi network**.  
   - The PC will receive VR tracking data over this Wi‑Fi.

3. **RealSense cameras**  
   - Connect two Intel RealSense cameras to the PC via USB.  
   - Use `realsense-viewer` to confirm that both cameras output RGB + Depth at **640×480** resolution.

---

## 2. 🐍 Python Environment

All teleoperation and data collection scripts should run in the `rdp_venv` Python virtual environment (❌ not a conda environment).

In **each terminal**, run:

```bash
conda deactivate          # make sure any conda env is not active
source rdp_venv/bin/activate
cd ~/reactive_diffusion_policy
```

Replace `~/reactive_diffusion_policy` with your actual repo path if different.

---

## 3. ⚙️ Real Robot Configuration (`real_robot_env.yaml`)

The key configuration file is:

```text
reactive_diffusion_policy/reactive_diffusion_policy/config/task/real_robot_env.yaml
```

A typical configuration looks like:

```yaml
robot_name: 'flexiv_rizon'

robot_server:
  host_ip: "192.168.2.101"
  port: 8092
  left_robot_ip: "192.168.2.100"

```

### 3.1 🌐 Set the VR server IP (`vr_server_ip`)

1. Power on the VR headset and connect it to the same Wi‑Fi as the PC.  
2. Check the **VR IP address** (e.g., `192.168.43.201`).  
3. Edit `real_robot_env.yaml` and set:

   ```yaml
   publisher:
     vr_server_ip: &vr_server_ip 'YOUR_VR_IP_HERE'
   ```

4. Save the file.

> 💡 **Tip:** The VR IP and the PC Wi‑Fi IP must be in the same subnet for communication to work reliably.

---

## 4. 🕶️ TactAR App Setup (VR Side)

On the VR headset, open **TactAR APP**:

1. In the TactAR settings, set the **first IP field** to the **PC's Wi‑Fi IP** (not the wired IP).  
2. Click **“Refresh IP”**.  
   - After this, the VR should start streaming pose and controller data to the PC at the specified IP and ports.

You can verify connectivity later by checking logs from `teleop.py`.

---

## 5. 🧭 VR–Robot Coordinate Calibration

You must calibrate the VR coordinate frame with the robot:

1. Follow the instructions from the TactAR repository (text + video):  
   <https://github.com/xiaoxiaoxh/TactAR_APP?tab=readme-ov-file>
2. In brief:
   - Align the large **white marker** in VR with the robot **base frame origin**.
   - Align the **black‑and‑white marker** with the robot **TCP (end‑effector)**.
3. Confirm and save the calibration so that the VR motion correctly maps to robot end‑effector motion.

> 🎯 Good calibration is crucial for intuitive and safe teleoperation.

## 6. 🎮 Launching Teleoperation and Data Recording

You need **3 terminals**, all with `rdp_venv` activated and working directory set to the repository.

### 6.1 🛰️ Terminal 1: Start Teleoperation Server

```bash
cd ~/reactive_diffusion_policy
source rdp_venv/bin/activate
python teleop.py task=wmx_data_collection
```

This:

- 🚀 Starts the teleoperation server  
- 📥 Receives VR tracking and button data  
- 📤 Sends TCP and gripper commands to the Flexiv robot via the robot server  

---

### 6.2 📷 Terminal 2: Start Camera Node Launcher

```bash
cd ~/reactive_diffusion_policy
source rdp_venv/bin/activate
python camera_node_launcher.py task=wmx_data_collection
```

This:

- 🎥 Starts RealSense camera nodes  
- Publishes color images to ROS2 topics:
  - `/external_camera/color/image_raw`
  - `/left_wrist_camera/color/image_raw`
- These topics are later synchronized with robot states for data recording.

---

### 6.3 💾 Terminal 3: Start Data Recorder

```bash
cd ~/reactive_diffusion_policy
source rdp_venv/bin/activate
python record_data.py seq_1.pkl
```

Notes:

- `seq_1.pkl` is the filename for the current recording session.  
- While running, the recorder:
  - Subscribes to camera topics and robot state topics.  
  - Uses ROS2 message_filters to temporally synchronize:
    - External and wrist images  
    - TCP pose / velocity / wrench  
    - Gripper width / force  
    - Joint positions (q), torques (tau), and external torques (tau_ext)  
  - Buffers data and saves them at the end of the session.

> 💡 You can keep `teleop.py` and `camera_node_launcher.py` running across multiple sequences and only restart `record_data.py` with a new output filename.

---

## 7. 📚 Data Collection Procedure

For each demonstration (one complete teleoperated task):

1. ✅ **Start the three processes**  
   - `teleop.py task=wmx_data_collection`  
   - `camera_node_launcher.py task=wmx_data_collection`  
   - `record_data.py seq_1.pkl` (or another filename)

2. 🎮 **Perform the task using VR teleoperation**  
   - Use the VR controllers (TactAR) to move the robot end-effector and control the gripper.  
   - Execute a meaningful task: e.g., reach, grasp, move, place, etc.

3. 🛑 **Stop recording once the task is finished**  
   - Go to **Terminal 3** (Data Recorder).  
   - Press `Ctrl+C` to stop `record_data.py`.  
   - Wait until the log shows something like:
     ```text
     Saved sensor messages to /path/to/seq_1.pkl
     ```
   - This indicates that the recording has been successfully saved.

4. ⏹️ **(Optional) Stop other processes**  
   - You can keep `teleop.py` and `camera_node_launcher.py` running if you plan to quickly record another sequence.  
   - Or you can stop them with `Ctrl+C` in their respective terminals.  
   - If you keep teleop running, be careful **not to accidentally press the side trigger** or other VR buttons, to avoid unexpected robot motion.

5. 🔁 **Record a new sequence**  
   - For the next demonstration, choose a new file name, e.g.:
     ```bash
     python record_data.py seq_2.pkl
     python record_data.py seq_3.pkl
     ```
   - Repeat steps 2–4.

## 8. 📡 Network & Latency Tips

VR-based teleoperation is sensitive to network latency and jitter:

- 📍 Keep the PC and VR headset **close to the Wi‑Fi router** and avoid obstacles.  
- 📶 If the company Wi‑Fi is unstable (ping spikes to hundreds or thousands of ms):
  - Try using your **phone’s hotspot** as Wi‑Fi for both PC and VR.  
  - Or temporarily disconnect unnecessary network interfaces on the PC to simplify routing.  
- You can check the VR link quality with:

  ```bash
  ping <VR_IP>
  ```

  - Most pings should be within ~10 ms.  
  - Occasional spikes are acceptable, but frequent large spikes will cause noticeable lag and jerky robot motion.

> 📡 **Tip:** If you see frequent high-latency pings (100 ms+), strongly consider switching networks before collecting important data.

## 9. ⚠️ Safety & Data Alignment

### 9.1 🛟 Safety

- Always ensure a **safe workspace** around the robot:
  - 🚷 No humans in the immediate workspace when teleoperation is active.  
  - 🛑 Emergency stop should be within easy reach.  
- Verify teleoperation behavior with **small, slow motions** before performing larger, faster movements.  
- If anything behaves unexpectedly, **release the VR controller, hit E-stop, and inspect the system** before continuing.

### 9.2 ⏱️ Data Alignment

- The Data Recorder uses ROS2 message_filters (ApproximateTimeSynchronizer) to synchronize topics.  
- Each recorded timestep includes:
  - External and wrist camera images  
  - TCP pose, velocity, wrench  
  - Gripper width and force  
  - Joint position (q), torque (tau), and external torque (tau_ext)  
- Therefore, **all modalities in a single timestep are time‑aligned**; there is no case where only images are recorded without corresponding robot state.

> ✅ This makes the resulting dataset well-suited for multimodal policy learning (vision + force + joint states).

## 10. 📴 Recommended Shutdown Order

For each recording session:

1. 🎮 Finish teleoperation for the current demonstration.  
2. 💾 In the **Data Recorder terminal**:
   - Press `Ctrl+C` to stop `record_data.py`.  
   - Wait for the “Saved sensor messages to ...” log.  
3. 📴 Optional: stop other processes:
   - `teleop.py` (teleoperation server)  
   - `camera_node_launcher.py` (RealSense publisher)  

This order minimizes the risk of losing data or leaving teleoperation active by accident.
